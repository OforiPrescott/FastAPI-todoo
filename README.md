A  CRUD application built with Python fastapi
C-CREATE
R-READ
U-UPDATE
D-DELETE

I used PyCharm IDE for my Project 


#SETUP

1. I called my application FastAPI todoo

2. Creating a new python virtual environment (

3. Installing fastapi and uvicorn (for me, pip install 'fastapi[all]')

4. Setting up a root project directory called FastAPI todoo/


Then you are ready to go.

-You create a main.py file inside FastAPI todoo/
 Note: Run this app from Terminal with "uvicorn main:app --reload"
 
 I also installed an  sqlalchemy. Its an sqlite database where I used to store our todo list items.  Run "pip install sqlalchemy" to install sqlalchemy
 
 We need to Create an Engine Instance for SQLALCHEMY
 
 This tells us what?
 
1.  what type of database youâ€™re connecting to
2. where that database is located
3. what your credentials are for connecting to the database
4. And a lots of other stuffs you can use for.


You can Follow from the codes.
